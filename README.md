# Canvas Runner

Canvas Runner is a minimal 2D playground rendered on a single HTML canvas. Guide the glowing sprite with the arrow keys and watch it glide across a subtly animated grid.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

The development server runs at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with hot module replacement. To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Bundled assets are emitted to `dist/`.

## Features

- Arrow-key movement with smooth diagonal motion and boundary clamping
- High-DPI aware canvas scaling so the sprite stays crisp on every screen
- Lightweight 2D rendering with a pulsing character and grid backdrop
- Modern toolchain powered by Webpack 5 and Babel
